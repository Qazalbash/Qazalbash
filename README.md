### Hey! I'm [@MeesumQ](https://twitter.com/MeesumQ) (Meesum Qazalbash) 👋

I am a fresh graduate (graduated in June 2024 🎓) in Computer Science (major) + Mathematics (minor), from [Habib University](https://habib.edu.pk/), Pakistan 🇵🇰. I work as a Research Assistant in the Computer Science Department at [Habib University](https://habib.edu.pk/).

I'm passionate about numerical/accelerated computing ⚡, machine/deep learning 🤖, and physics-informed machine learning 🌩️. During my undergrad, I explored various projects (available on my GitHub).

Currently, I'm working on Bayesian Inference for Binary Black Holes with members of the LIGO community 🚀, developing a device-agnostic Python package, [GWKokab](https://github.com/gwkokab/gwkokab) 📦, using [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
