### Hey! I'm [@MeesumQ](https://twitter.com/MeesumQ) (Meesum Qazalbash) 👋

I am a fresh graduate (graduated in June 2024 🎓) in Computer Science + Mathematics minor, from [Habib University](https://habib.edu.pk/), Pakistan 🇵🇰.

I'm passionate about numerical/accelerated computing ⚡, machine/deep learning 🤖, and physics informed machine learning 🌩️. During my undergrad, I explored various projects (available on my GitHub).

Currently, I'm working on Bayesian Inference for Binary Black Holes with LIGO 🚀, developing a device-agnostic Python package, [GWKokab](https://github.com/gwkokab/gwkokab) (not public yet) 📦, using [JAX](https://jax.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html).
